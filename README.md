# Time Series Worflow Marketplace platform

TSWF-Marketplace is a simple platform for publishing Time Series services based on semantic definitions with tswf-schema. It allows to upload workflows with previously created time series either to compose workflows from scratch or to combine different workflows to conform a complete TS service that is easily portable between services and Cloud Computing platforms. 

## Aims 

The idea behind this marketplace is to provide a repository of Time-Series service definitions that can be ported to different Cloud Computing providers without having to worry about the underlying computing infrastructure or platform.

Service definition using semantic technology, this means a qualitative and quantitative step in the industrialization of cloud services offering rich descriptions that are easily discoverable, portable and extensible.


## Features

- Upload workflows with semantic descriptions from **tswf-schema** in *jsonld*, *RDF* or *ttl*.
- Compose time-series workflows using Building-Blocks tools. Export composition to **tswf-schema** ready to publish.
- Publish workflows as ready-to-use time-series services in Cloud Computing providers. This might includes the cost aspects of the service, SLA, authentication, etc.
